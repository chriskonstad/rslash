# TODO

* [x] store subreddits for suggesting later
* [x] used stored subreddits to help autocomplete
* [ ] add fuzzy matching
* [ ] better suggestion ordering (popularity/closeness)
* [x] don't save a subreddit if it doesn't exist (URL is a search page)
* [x] don't save data when in incognito, per google guidelines
* [x] be able to remove select subreddits from list
* [x] be able to clear data
* [x] make options page nicer
* [ ] reset the counts on a schedule (weekly?), but keep the subreddit listed
      so that new subreddits can surpass old subreddits if they're visited a lot.
      Or do exponentially weighted moving average stuff instead.
* [ ] remove alerts for production
* [ ] make sure filter doesn't filter out perfect matches
* [ ] ask for user confirmation in options before deleting all subreddits
